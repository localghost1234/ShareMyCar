Hello! To create an executable with 'PyInstaller', follow the next steps:

1. Run this command (assuming you acquired the necessary dependencies):
	pyinstaller --onefile --windowed --clean --add-data --icon=static/red_car_icon.ico --name ShareMyCar main.py

2. Do a copy-paste of the file called 'carsharing.db' on the same folder as the new .exe (to use the database info)
